# Data Analysis, Processing, and Visualization Project

## Introduction
This project is a collaborative effort with Dell EMC and Ben-Gurion University, focused on comprehensive data analysis from cleaning and preprocessing to modeling and visualization, using Python.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning and predictive modeling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
